    <h2 class="section-heading">About us</h2>
	<p class="text-light">Rajasthan! Known to be the land of Rajputs. The state is known for its royal culture and customs. But amidst this glorious culture and heritage, there is a story. The story of a child who is born and brought up here. The story of a child who has to give in to social norms of the society. The story of a child who deserves an education that empowers him/her to make an independent choice, an education that makes him/her question and an education that empowers him/her to dream! But the question is, how many of these children are getting that education? How many of them are being exposed to that education? Not many! This is what we are here for. Sashaktikaran Foundation is a not for profit organization based out of Jaipur. We work towards our vision by building capacity in teachers. We will recruit the most committed and dedicated teachers from the city. They will be trained and motivated for a period of a month. They will then be inducted into the project and placed in the schools we intervene with. They will be placed in the school for a minimum of an year and supported throughout the year. This team of teachers is going to work towards our vision in the school that we are working with. The idea is that if the teachers are strong and supported and motivated in every way, they will be super invested in the classroom and kids’ learning. If teachers understand the importance of the work they do and they feel valued, they can transform the lives of the students they teach. In turn the teachers will get an opportunity to develop and grow in their role as a mentor and a leader.</p>
	<h3 class="section-sub-heading">Our Vision:</h3>
    <p class="text-light" >“All children in Rajasthan will get an education that empowers.”
		We strongly believe, education will empower our children to make a well informed choice in their
		life. It will empower them to do what their heart speaks. It will empower them to speak up without
		any fear or inhibition. It will empower them to analyze themselves and become better human
		beings.
 </p>
	<h3 class="section-sub-heading">Our Mission:</h3>
	<p class="text-light" >“We will provide teacher training, motivation and support to the teachers by creating enriching
experiences for them, who in turn impact their classrooms within their school.”</p>

					<h4 class="text-light"> In the year 2017, we are intervening with our first school in Jaipur. We will be working with this low income private school and take up the whole primary section. We will be doing every thing in the school from setting up school culture, to getting teachers, training them and supporting them in their mentorship and leadership journey. 
In this school we will be working with 6 teachers who will be impacting 175 students in the school. This school Geeta Ashram works under a trust called Raghukul Shiksha Samiti. The school has been running in Sodala area for last 15 years. The school currently has students from Nursery to grade 7. The students in the school mostly come from Sushil Pura and Ashok Pura Kachi Basti near Sodala Area in Jaipur.Most of the children in the community arre first generation learners. Most of the parents work as drivers or street vendors.We believe that every child should get an education that empowers him/her irrespective of his/her socio economic backkground. This is what we evision in the school this year.

                	<!-- <p class="lead text-muted"> The teachers will be inducted in the programme with a 5 week training programme. After this they will be supported by a mentor in the school who will provide him/her emotional as well as pedagogical support. Time and again we will have learning circles for the whole staff in the school. Thorough observations and feedback will be a consistent structure in the school.</p> -->
